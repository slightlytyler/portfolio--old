Website / native iOS app for Dropclock Entertainment. I've worked with Dropclock for 2 years designing flyers and social media ads and decided that the website needed a little TLC, too. Designed with a focus on photography and images, the website acts as a base for fans to find information about up-coming events, and explore artists and music.

This one is still on the launchpad, but hopefully should be getting deployed after the start of the Summer.

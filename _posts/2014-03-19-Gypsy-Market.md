Originally designed this site for the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MissippyGypsy">Missippy Gypsy</a> but decided to continue on with it and develop a full Shopify theme. <i>Gypsy Market</i> is a wide-screen friendly, minimalistic store with a host of sort functions for variety heavy collections. Modern features such as look books encourage the shopper to explore and use the model's style as a guide and incentive.

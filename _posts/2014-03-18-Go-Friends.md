I'm a big fan of the ancient Chinese board game, Go. I've been searching for a "play by mail" mobile version for a while and haven't found any in the app stores. 

Meet <i>Go Friends</i>. Designed for easy multiplayer play in single servings or spread out throughout the day. Users can play through the respective app game centers, peer to peer, or old-school pass and play.
